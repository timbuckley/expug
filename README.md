# Expug

> Indented shorthand HTML templates for Elixir

Expug is a template language based on [Pug][] (formerly known as [Jade][]).
It lets you write HTML as indented shorthand, inspired by Haml, Slim, Pug/Jade, and so on.


```jade
doctype html
html
  meta(charset="utf-8")
  title Hello, world!
body
  a(href=@link)
    | This is a link
```

[Pug]: http://pugjs.org/
[Jade]: http://jade-lang.com/

## Installation

Add expug to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:expug, "~> 0.8"}]
end
```

Also see [phoenix_expug](https://github.com/rstacruz/phoenix_expug) for Phoenix integration.

## Syntax

Use CSS-like selectors for elements, and express your nesting through indentations.

```jade
ul.links
  li
    a(href="/") This is a link
```
